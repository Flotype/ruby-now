RubyNow
=======

This is meant to be a Ruby client for NowJS. It's not quite as
feature-rich as the Node library itself, but it permits for RPC with
an arbitrary chain of callbacks, which we figured was the main reason
folks use Now. Have fun!

You'll need to `gem build ruby-now.gemspec` before `gem install ruby-now`, by
the way.
